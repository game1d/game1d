Hello, my name for now is @game1d. Might look into something more professional.

I am currently learning ICT.
Outside of that i keep myself with sport and too many video games.

Iâ€™m looking forward to build a bright future. Even if there are a few bumps on the way there.

If anything in my sentences or grammer looks weird, english is my second language and I am am bad at grammer in my native tongue already.

Have a nice day.
